	A chemical peel is a skin-resurfacing procedure that involves applying a chemical solution to the skin to remove its outer layers, promoting the growth of new, smoother skin. It's typically used on the face, neck, or hands and can address various skin concerns, such as:
<ul>
<li>Wrinkles and fine lines</li>
<li>Sun damage</li>
<li>Acne scars</li>
<li>Hyperpigmentation (dark spots or uneven skin tone)</li>
<li>Rough texture </li>
</ul>
Chemical peels are available in different strengths: <em>light, medium, and deep</em>. Each type uses a different chemical solution—like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), trichloroacetic acid (TCA), or phenol—depending on the desired depth of treatment. A dermatologist or licensed aesthetician typically performs the procedure, and recovery time varies depending on the depth of the peel.
