	<h4>I wanted to go with a feminist poster because of the rise in 	femicides and regression in women rights. I chose the white house 	because it symbolizes power and I got the photo off of 	Pinterest. I 	generated the body of a politician and got a screencap from Bill 	Clinton's impeachment trial of Monica Lewinsky and edited it to make 	it look like she's sitting at 	the table. I used an article of 	domestic abuse from google and 	blended it onto the carpet. I chose 	overlay because I wanted the article to look like it was the carpet 	and maintain the coloring and pattern.
<p></p>
	I photoshopped a picture of a fetus that I got off of google to make 	it look like it was floating. I pasted it on the collage to make it 	look similar to streamers or 	curtains. I copied and pasted it and
	resized it each time to get that effect. I erased parts to make it 	blend better and then added more
	copies to fix the edges.
