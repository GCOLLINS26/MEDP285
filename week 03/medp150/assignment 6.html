	<h4>I chose New Orleans because I think it's a beautiful destination. I visited it for my sister's
birthday and I want to do a road trip with that as the destination. I chose this picture because I
like the layout. I chose blue green and blue because I chose the triad choice on the color
harmony. I first started with vectoring the sky out and painted it green to make it the opposite of
blue because green would be on the ground not the sky. Then I painted the road and sidewalk
blue and pink and just filled it out. I found difficulty coloring the buildings so they won't blend in
together. So after I added vector points to carve out the buildings, I used the mesh tool to create
a gradient/ watercolor effect. I did this throughout all the buildings and then on one of the
buildings added the balcony and doors and windows and flower pots using the shape tools. I
used the drawing tool to finish the balcony and draw out more details. The other buildings I just
added the windows and some borders with the shape tool. I added a mountain with the ai
generator to add more color to the sky, specifically the blue and pink. After I finished off the
buildings, I added some drawn trees and bushes and colored in any empty spots. In the end i ai
generated blue pink and green cars to go over the cars in the original photo and then cleaned
up the photo. It was a little difficult to get the layers to work out to make the scene blend out
better. It was also hard making the mountain and windows perspectives look correct</h4>
