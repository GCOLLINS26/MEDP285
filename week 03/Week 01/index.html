	<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>I am a 19 year old student at Hunter College. I am studying premed and film with the intention of becoming a Vet and animator. I am from Jamaica but was raised in New York. In my free time I lie to crochet, do makeup and play video games. I am in a sorority. I like to hang with friends and try new things</p>

	<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p> When I was in middle school, I used to watch the reboot of Voltron. The first 4 seasons were extremely engaging and I would rush home to watch the new season and would finish it all in one day. However, after season 4, the quality of storytelling went down. A lot of viewers were easily pointing out a lot of plot holes and inaccuracies that could've been easily prevented. It got to the point where we as a fandom, no matter what you shipped or who your favorite character was, refused to acknowledge the final season. I decided that I would pursue animation in hopes of redoing the show myself and then my love for the animated media grew from there. 

Iâ€™ve noticed that there has been a decline in stories involving unambiguous black people but women specifically. Since the 90s, there has been a very obvious trope where there will be 2 fully black parents and they will have a dark-skinned son and a biracial daughter. The subtle erasure of monoracial black girls has always been weird to me so I decided to create stories for black girls and women while using animation because I think animation is the perfect way to tell any story ranging from romance, fantasy, or drama. A lot of the time stories don't translate very well into live-action like it does with animation. So while one goal of mine is to represent black people in any genre, it is also to make animation a widely accepted genre for everyone because it is always looked down on. After all, people assume it's only for kids when there have been well-written adult animations with different target audiences. For example, the Cleveland show, Vox Machina, and Kipo tell stories that work perfectly with animation that wouldn't translate well with live action. The target audience for the Cleveland show can watch Kipo because these stories aren't for specific ages (kids shouldn't be watching vox machines, however).
