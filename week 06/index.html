<p>The term Op Art was first used in a 1964 article, about Polish artist Julian Stanczak’s (1928-2017) show Optical Paintings. The article was published in Time Magazine. The term was short for Optical Art. It refers to an art movement in the 1960s and 1970s in which abstract art was being produced in a way that involved optical illusions. Artworks were typically created by combining black and white shapes in a way that gave the impression that movement was occurring when it was not. As viewers approached these pieces they seemed to move, flash or warp or hidden images appeared from certain angles and not from others. Sometimes called, Trompe L’oeil, or “trick of the eye” in French, the illusionary affect was Another form of abstract art, Optical art was influenced by Neo-Impressionism, Cubism, Futurism and Dada art. However, perhaps the most influential movement was constructivism which gained popularity in the Bauhaus.</p>
