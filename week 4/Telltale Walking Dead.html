<h1>Summary</h1>
<br>
<h4>Telltale's The Walking Dead is a narrative-driven adventure game set in the post-apocalyptic world of The Walking Dead universe. It follows the story of Lee Everett, a convicted criminal who becomes a protector to a young girl named Clementine after a zombie outbreak. The game emphasizes choices, with players making decisions that affect the story and relationships with other characters. Over multiple seasons, the focus shifts to Clementine as she grows up and struggles to survive in a brutal, collapsing world. The game is known for its emotional storytelling, character-driven drama, and moral dilemmas.</h4>

<h1>History</h1>
<br>
<h4>Telltale's The Walking Dead launched in 2012, revolutionizing narrative-driven games with its episodic structure and focus on player choice. Developed by Telltale Games, it was based on Robert Kirkman’s comic series The Walking Dead. The first season received critical acclaim for its emotional depth and storytelling, particularly the bond between Lee Everett and Clementine. Telltale released four main seasons, with Clementine becoming the central character as the series progressed. The game’s success helped popularize episodic gaming and choice-driven narratives, influencing the broader gaming landscape, though Telltale itself faced financial struggles, eventually closing in 2018 before being revived.</h4>

<h1>Why I like it</h1>

<h4>I enjoy Telltale's The Walking Dead because of its deep character dynamics and emotional relationships, especially tbetween Lee and Clementine because of the trope where emotionally unavailabe man takes care of naive girl. I love that I dont know where the game is going to end up and how i can compare my choices with othert players. The game’s focus on discovery, survival, and moral conflicts in a post-apocalyptic world aligns with my interest because I am also preparing for the end of the world. I like to be prepared. </h4>
