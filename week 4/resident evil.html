<h1>Summary</h1>

<br>
<h4>The Resident Evil series is a popular survival horror franchise that is centered around the battle against bioterrorism and viral outbreaks caused by the nefarious company, The Umbrella Corporation. The series follows different characters like Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, Leon S. Kennedy, and Claire Redfield and eventually my favorite Ethan as they confront zombies, mutated creatures, and sinister organizations. Beginning with the viral outbreak in Raccoon City, the games evolve into global threats involving bio-organic weapons. Known for its tense atmosphere, puzzle-solving, and action-packed gameplay, Resident Evil has become a staple in both gaming and horror media.</h4>

<h1>History</h1>
<br>
<h4>The Resident Evil series, created by Capcom, debuted in 1996, pioneering the survival horror genre. The first game introduced players to the viral outbreak in a mansion, later expanding to the infamous Raccoon City incident in Resident Evil 2 (1998). The franchise evolved with each installment, mixing horror, action, and intricate storylines about the Umbrella Corporation's bio-weapons. The series underwent a major shift in gameplay with Resident Evil 4 (2005), introducing a more action-focused style. Later games, such as Resident Evil 7 (2017), returned to its horror roots while maintaining a modern feel, cementing its status as a genre-defining franchise.</h4>

<h1>Why I like it</h1>

<h4>I enjoy the Resident Evil series for the over arcing character development and evolving relationships, like my favorite couple Leon and Ada and the friend ship between leon and chris. I also like rooting for Ethan despite the odds against him. The series also delves into intergenerational conflicts, such as the ongoing fight against the Umbrella Corporation, a powerful force behind the viral outbreaks. Additionally, the themes of discovery and survival, as characters unravel hidden conspiracies, resonate with my appreciation for complex storytelling and tension-filled environments.</h4>
